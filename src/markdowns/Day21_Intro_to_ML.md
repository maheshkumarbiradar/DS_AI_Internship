# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data rather than manually coding every rule. Instead of telling the computer exactly how to solve a problem step by step, we give it examples of inputs and their correct outputs, and it discovers the patterns on its own. This makes machine learning useful for solving complex problems where writing fixed rules is difficult, such as predicting customer behavior, recognizing images, or detecting spam emails.

## 1 Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the dataset contains input data along with correct output labels (answers). 

The model learns a mapping function from inputs to outputs by analyzing labeled examples. Once trained, it can predict outputs for new, unseen data.

Common Tasks:
- Classification (Spam / Not Spam)
- Regression (Predicting prices)

## 2 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning is used when the dataset does not contain labeled outputs. 

The model tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or clusters within the data without being told the correct answers.

Common Tasks:
- Clustering
- Association rule mining
- Dimensionality reduction

## 3 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a learning approach where an agent interacts with an environment and learns by receiving rewards or penalties.

The model improves its behavior over time by maximizing cumulative reward through trial and error.

Common Applications:
- Robotics
- Game playing AI
- Autonomous systems
